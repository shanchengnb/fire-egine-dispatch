## Data Availability Statement

This study provides a subset of publicly available datasets (e.g., drv_time_osrm_renamed, station mapping/xy.pkl), trained models (TRAIN MODEL, models, and tensorboard), analysis code (EVALUATE MODEL), and processed analytical datasets (eval_output) to enable reproduction of the results. Two public OneDrive links are provided, containing the materials necessary for reproducing the analyses, excluding the following datasets:

Original training dataset: real_with_dispatch_info

Evaluation dataset: wmfs_mobilisations

These datasets were supplied by the West Midlands Fire Service and are considered private; therefore, they cannot be shared publicly.

The publicly accessible materials include:

Final analytical and visualization datasets derived from the original data

Training and evaluation code

Simulation environment code

Trained reinforcement learning models

Partial datasets (e.g., OSRM dataset)

Additionally, a private GitHub repository contains the complete research package, including the original datasets, processed data, code, and trained models. Access to this repository is currently restricted to the project supervisor, collaborators, and the author.

Researchers interested in reproducing this study may contact the author or collaborators to request access. Any access will strictly follow data sharing agreements, ethical requirements, and the terms of use defined by the data provider.

This arrangement ensures the reproducibility of the research methods and analytical results while respecting the confidentiality and usage restrictions of the West Midlands Fire Service data.
